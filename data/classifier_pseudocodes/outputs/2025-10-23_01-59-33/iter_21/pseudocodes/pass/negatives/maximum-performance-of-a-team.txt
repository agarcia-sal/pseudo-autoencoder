```
1. pair each (efficiency, speed) → engineers
2. sort engineers desc by efficiency
3. init min-heap speed_heap, speed_sum = 0, max_perf = 0
4. for (eff, spd) in engineers:
5.     push spd to speed_heap
6.     speed_sum += spd
7.     if size(speed_heap) > k:
8.         speed_sum -= pop min from speed_heap
9.     max_perf = max(max_perf, speed_sum * eff)
10. return max_perf mod (10^9 + 7)
