    FUNCTION originalDigits WITH PARAMETER s  
        ASSIGN pointer TO a new character frequency counter based on s  
        INITIALIZE digits AS a list of ten zeros corresponding to counts of digits zero through nine  
        SET the element at position zero of digits TO the number of occurrences of character z in the counter  
        SET the element at position two of digits TO the number of occurrences of character w in the counter  
        SET the element at position four of digits TO the number of occurrences of character u in the counter  
        SET the element at position six of digits TO the number of occurrences of character x in the counter  
        SET the element at position eight of digits TO the number of occurrences of character g in the counter  
        SET the element at position three of digits TO the number of occurrences of character h in the counter MINUS the element at position eight of digits  
        SET the element at position five of digits TO the number of occurrences of character f in the counter MINUS the element at position four of digits  
        SET the element at position seven of digits TO the number of occurrences of character s in the counter MINUS the element at position six of digits  
        SET the element at position nine of digits TO the number of occurrences of character i in the counter MINUS the element at position five of digits MINUS the element at position six of digits MINUS the element at position eight of digits  
        SET the element at position one of digits TO the number of occurrences of character o in the counter MINUS the element at position zero of digits MINUS the element at position two of digits MINUS the element at position four of digits  
        INITIALIZE result AS an empty list  
        FOR index FROM zero TO nine  
            APPEND the string representation of index multiplied by the element at position index of digits TO result  
        END FOR  
        RETURN the concatenation of all elements of result into a single string
