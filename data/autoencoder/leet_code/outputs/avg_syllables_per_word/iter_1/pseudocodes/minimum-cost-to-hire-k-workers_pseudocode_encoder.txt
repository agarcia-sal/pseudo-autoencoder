```
sort workers by (wage/quality) ratio as (r,q)
max_heap = [], total_q = 0, min_cost = ∞
for each (r,q) in workers:
    push -q into max_heap; total_q += q
    if size(max_heap) > k:
        total_q += pop(max_heap)  # pop returns negative quality
    if size(max_heap) == k:
        min_cost = min(min_cost, total_q * r)
return min_cost
