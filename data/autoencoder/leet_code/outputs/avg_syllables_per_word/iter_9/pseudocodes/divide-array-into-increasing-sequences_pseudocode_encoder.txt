CLASS Solution  
    FUNCTION canDivideIntoSubsequences(self, nums, k)  
        SET freq TO the frequency count of each element in nums  
        SET max_freq TO the greatest value among the frequencies in freq  
        RETURN the integer division of the length of nums by k GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO max_freq  
    END FUNCTION
