    FUNCTION waysToDistribute WITH PARAMETERS n AND k  
        SET MOD TO ten raised to the power of nine PLUS one  
        INITIALIZE dp AS a two dimensional collection of zeroes with the first dimension size equal to n incremented by one AND the second dimension size equal to k incremented by one  
        SET element at position zero of dp at position zero TO one
