    FUNCTION rearrangeSticks WITH PARAMETERS n AND k  
        SET MODULO TO ten raised to the power of nine PLUS one  
        INITIALIZE two dimensional collection named dp WITH the first dimension size set to n PLUS one AND the second dimension size set to k PLUS one FILLED WITH zero  
        SET element at position zero of dp at position zero TO one  
        FOR each integer i FROM one TO n  
            FOR each integer j FROM one TO k  
                SET element at position i of dp at position j TO the sum of element at position i MINUS one of dp at position j MINUS one PLUS the product of i MINUS one AND element at position i MINUS one of dp at position j TAKEN MODULO MODULO
