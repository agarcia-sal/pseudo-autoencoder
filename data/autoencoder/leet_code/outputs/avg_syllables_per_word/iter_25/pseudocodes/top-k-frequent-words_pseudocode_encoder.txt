    FUNCTION topKFrequent WITH PARAMETERS words AND k  
        SET count TO a mapping of each distinct element in words to the number of its occurrences  
        SET heap TO a list created by for each word and its frequency in count obtaining the pair consisting of the negative of the frequency and the word itself  
        TRANSFORM heap into a heap data structure organizing elements by their natural heap order  
        SET result TO a list created by repeating k times the extraction of the element at the second position of the minimum element removed from heap  
        RETURN result  
    END FUNCTION
