```
for each unit in volume:
    i = k
    while i > 0 and heights[i-1] <= heights[i]: i -= 1
    while i < k and heights[i] == heights[i+1]: i += 1
    if i < k: heights[i] += 1; continue

    i = k
    while i < n-1 and heights[i+1] <= heights[i]: i += 1
    while i > k and heights[i] == heights[i-1]: i -= 1
    if i > k: heights[i] += 1; continue

    heights[k] += 1

return heights
